# pm2_5_air_pollution_prediction_and_forecast
Analysis of Air Pollution prediction and time-series forecast of PM2.5 Pollutant using Machine Learning Algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) and Deep Learning Algorithms (CNN, Bi-LSTM). Also considered for improved performances is random search hyper-parameter tuning using Ray-Tune with HyperBand Scheduler strategy.
